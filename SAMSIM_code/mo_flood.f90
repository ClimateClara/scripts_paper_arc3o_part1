!! Computes the fluxes caused by liquid flooding the snow layer.
!!
!! Water floods the snow layer instantly transforming it to ice which is added to the top layer.
!! As long as the negative freeboard is smaller then a certain parameter (neg_free) the flood strength is limited by the harmonic mean permeability of the whole ice layer driven by the freeboard.  
!! When this parameter is exceed, instant flooding is assumed. 
!! Based on Ted Maksyms work, brine is moved from the ocean to the snow without interacting with the ice in between.
!! Very little of the process is well understood, so this parametrisation is
!! ID mostly speculation.
!! Ratio_flood is a very important parameter, as it regulates how much wicking into the snow layer occurs during melting which dilutes the flooded snow. 
!! Ratio of two should lead  to the snow pack being reduced twice as much as the top layer grows.
