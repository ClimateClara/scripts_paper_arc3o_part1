\subsection{Detailed Description}
SAMSIM Semi-\/Adaptive Multi-\/phase Sea-\/Ice Model. This model was developed from scratch by Philipp Griewank during and after his PhD at Max Planck Institute of Meteorology from 2010-\/2014. The code is intended to be understandable and is subroutines, modules, functions, parameters, and global variables all have doxygen compatible descriptions. In addition to the doxygen generated description a getting started document helps first time users get the model running, and some python plotscripts are available to plot model output.

The module \hyperlink{namespacemo__grotz}{mo\_\-grotz} is the most important subroutine in which the timestepping occurs. (Named after GRiewank nOTZ) Mo\_\-grotz is called by \hyperlink{SAMSIM_8f90}{SAMSIM.f90}. \hyperlink{SAMSIM_8f90}{SAMSIM.f90}'s only purpose is to set the testcase number and description string.

Main subroutine of SAMSIM, a 1D thermodynamic seaice model. A semi-\/adaptive grid is used which is managed by \hyperlink{namespacemo__layer__dynamics}{mo\_\-layer\_\-dynamics}. To many things happen in this subroutine to describe in this description, you'll just have to go through it. 

IMPORTANT: To get the correct freshwater amount make sure the freshwater is calculated using a salinity value to compare against.

Common errors leading to termination are: too small timestep, bad programming
