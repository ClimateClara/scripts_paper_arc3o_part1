Computes surface temperature and heatfluxes. 

Major subroutine, calculates all atmospheric energy fluxes and applies both atmospheric and oceanic fluxes. Is one of the only subroutines to directly use \hyperlink{namespacemo__data}{mo\_\-data} because so many variables are needed.

There are three different ways to calculate atmospheric heat fluxes implemented which are defined using boundflux\_\-flag.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 1 imitates top cooling plate by setting a fixed surface temperature, heat flux is derived from the T gradient from the surface to the top layer
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 2 balances incoming and outgoing radiation to determine the surface temperature, heat flux is then calculated as in boundflux\_\-flag 1. Some of the ice penetrates into the ice as is absorbed according to Beer's law. Optical properties are defined by the parameters emissivity\_\-ice, emissivity\_\-snow, extinct, and penetr.
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 3 assumes the atmospheric heat flux is proportional to the difference between the top layer temperature and the air temperature.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For 1 and 2 the surface temperature in turn determines the atmospheric heat flux into the snow or ice. Atmoflux\_\-flag is important for boundflux\_\-flag 2, as it determines which atmospheric fluxes are used.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Atmoflux\_\-flag: 1 Mean climatology fluxes of Notz are used (see sub\_\-notz)
\item Atmoflux\_\-flag: 2 Imported values are used, see sub\_\-input for more info on reading in data.
\item Atmoflux\_\-flag: 3 Prescribed values are used (e.g. testcase 5).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Melting occurs when the surface T is above the melting temperature of the top layer
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 1 atmospheric flux is limited by the parameter max\_\-flux\_\-plate which represents the maximum heating capacity of the plate
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 2 the atmospheric heat flux is given by the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation
\item Boundflux\_\-flag: 3 works the same during melt and freezing, but a different proportionality parameter is used (alpha\_\-flux\_\-stable) because the air above the ice is assumed to be stably stratified.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Boundflux\_\-flag 1 and 3 are not made to work with snow. If you need snow you'll have to implement snow cover yourself. For a detailed look at what is happening see the source code.

The snow layer is treated differently based on the snow thickness.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the snow layer is thinner than thick\_\-min/100 it is simply ignored.
\item If the snow layer is thinner than thick\_\-min but thicker than thick\_\-min/100 the snow and top ice layer are assumed to have the same temperature and are coupled using snow\_\-coupling.
\item If the snow layer is thicker than thick\_\-min it is treated totally separately.
\end{DoxyItemize}
